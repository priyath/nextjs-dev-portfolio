Finite State Machines (FSMs) were last spotted in the wild in my digital design lectures, never to be really thought of
again, until recently when I stumbled upon an interesting paradigm for frontend development: building UIs powered by finite
state machines.

Any developer who has done any frontend development would agree that UI development can get very complex. The complexities could not just be in design and architecture, but also in the implementation details of the application and the unpredictable nature of end-user interactions.
