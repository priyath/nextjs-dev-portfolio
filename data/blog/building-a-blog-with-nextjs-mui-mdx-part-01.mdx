I finally got around to publishing my [personal website/blog](https://github.com/priyath/priyathgregory.dev) built using NextJS, Material UI and MDX. This article is the first of a two-part series, where I aim to provide an overview of the technical stack that I used, and how it was all put together to make a functional website that you could possibly use as inspiration for your personal projects.

The first article will walk-through the initial set up and the base framework to create a functional blog using NextJS and Material UI. The second article will cover the integration of MDX to create, manage and render blog content.

All source code explained in this tutorial is available on [github as a reusable boilerplate](https://github.com/priyath/nextjs-blog-boilerplate).

Let's get started!

## The Technical Stack

1. Client Framework - SEO is an important aspect for a website. A normal react application is rendered on the client, and as a result is not very SEO friendly. Because of this I decided to use [NextJS](), a web framework that supports server-side-rendering for client applications.
2. Component Library - [Material UI]() was selected as the component library of choice, for its maturity, extensive documentation and room for customization if needed. Also familiarity with the library from some previous projects helped as well.
3. Blog Content - [MDX]() supports markdown content and does one better by allowing component integration into plain old markdown. This allows for highly customisable content, And to make things even better, NextJS already has very decent integration patterns with MDX.
4. Comment System - [Giscus]() is an open source comment system that uses github discussions for its backend. It allows visitors to leave comments and reactions via Github.
5. Deployment - [Vercel]() was used for deployment which is almost a no-brainer due to its seamless integration with NextJS and the hobby pricing tier - which is free for non-commercial sites.

## Setting up NextJS with Material UI
Start by setting up a NextJS project using the `next-app` command like so:

```bash
yarn create next-app --typescript
```

Next let us install the required Material UI dependencies for the app.

```bash
yarn add @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/cache @emotion/react @emotion/server @emotion/styled -D @emotion/babel-plugin
```
A few things to note,

1. Emotion is the default and recommended styling engine used by Material UI and I see no valid reason to [replace](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability) it with anything else. Further to this, Material UI's component styling pattern is via either the common `styled` API or the `sx` prop, and hence the selected styling engine will anyway be hidden "under the hood".
2. `@emotion/cache` allows for low level customisation of how styles get inserted by Emotion.
3. `@emotion/server` is required for server side rendering with Emotion to extract css from html to strings.
4. `@emotion/babel-plugin` is used for the optimisation and minification of Emotion styles.

With the dependencies out of the way, let us set up a basic `theme.ts` file for Material UI in the `styles` folder.

```typescript
import { createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';
import { red } from '@mui/material/colors';

// Create a theme instance.
const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#556cd6',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#19857b',
    },
    error: {
      main: red.A400,
    },
  },
});

export default theme;
```

Now we need to do some one-time NextJS specific customisations to get the Material UI - NextJS combo working nicely together.

### _document

The `_document` is a [special file](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document) in NextJS that determines the overall html structure of the application. A Custom `_document` file may be required for libraries like CSS-in-JS to support server-side rendering.

As this is the case for us, lets go ahead and create a file named `_document.tsx` and save it under the `pages` folder. Update the file with the following code (derived from [Material UI's NextJS integration example](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/master/examples/nextjs/pages/_document.js)), which essentially configures Emotion with NextJS and ensures our styling is applied as expected during server-side rendering.

```typescript:_document_.tsx:collapsed
import * as React from 'react';
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';
import createEmotionServer from '@emotion/server/create-instance';
import createEmotionCache from '../lib/createEmotionCache';

export default class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html lang="en">
        <Head>
          {/* PWA primary color */}
          {/*<meta name="theme-color" content={theme.palette.primary.main} />*/}
          <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/static/favicon.ico" />
          <link
            rel="stylesheet"
            href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap"
          />

          {/* Inject MUI styles first to match with the prepend: true configuration. */}
          {(this.props as any).emotionStyleTags}
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

// `getInitialProps` belongs to `_document` (instead of `_app`),
// it's compatible with static-site generation (SSG).
MyDocument.getInitialProps = async (ctx) => {
  // Resolution order
  //
  // On the server:
  // 1. app.getInitialProps
  // 2. page.getInitialProps
  // 3. document.getInitialProps
  // 4. app.render
  // 5. page.render
  // 6. document.render
  //
  // On the server with error:
  // 1. document.getInitialProps
  // 2. app.render
  // 3. page.render
  // 4. document.render
  //
  // On the client
  // 1. app.getInitialProps
  // 2. page.getInitialProps
  // 3. app.render
  // 4. page.render

  const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage;

  // You can consider sharing the same emotion cache between all the SSR requests to speed up performance.
  // However, be aware that it can have global side effects.
  const cache = createEmotionCache();
  const { extractCriticalToChunks } = createEmotionServer(cache);

  ctx.renderPage = () =>
    originalRenderPage({
      enhanceApp: (App: any) =>
        function EnhanceApp(props) {
          return <App emotionCache={cache} {...props} />;
        },
    });

  const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);
  // This is important. It prevents emotion to render invalid HTML.
  // See https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/26561#issuecomment-855286153
  const emotionStyles = extractCriticalToChunks(initialProps.html);
  const emotionStyleTags = emotionStyles.styles.map((style) => (
    <style
      data-emotion={`${style.key} ${style.ids.join(' ')}`}
      key={style.key}
      // eslint-disable-next-line react/no-danger
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: style.css }}
    />
  ));

  return {
    ...initialProps,
    emotionStyleTags,
  };
};
```

### _app.tsx

`_app.tsx` is a [special component](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app) in NextJS that is used to initialize every page. Let's go ahead and update the current `_app.tsx` file under `pages` with the [following](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/master/examples/nextjs/pages/_app.js) content to complete the setup of Emotion with support for server-side rendering.

This updated code simply wraps each rendered page component with a `CacheProvider` and MUI's `ThemeProvider` to support the integration of Emotion and Material UI respectively.

```typescript:_app.tsx:collapsed
import * as React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import Head from 'next/head';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
import CssBaseline from '@mui/material/CssBaseline';
import { CacheProvider, EmotionCache} from '@emotion/react';
import theme from '../styles/theme';
import createEmotionCache from '../lib/createEmotionCache';

// Client-side cache, shared for the whole session of the user in the browser.
const clientSideEmotionCache = createEmotionCache();

export default function MyApp(props: { Component: any; emotionCache?: EmotionCache | undefined; pageProps: any; }) {
  const { Component, emotionCache = clientSideEmotionCache, pageProps } = props;

  return (
      <CacheProvider value={emotionCache}>
        <Head>
          <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, width=device-width" />
        </Head>
        <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
          {/* CssBaseline kickstart an elegant, consistent, and simple baseline to build upon. */}
          <CssBaseline />
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </ThemeProvider>
      </CacheProvider>
  );
}

MyApp.propTypes = {
  Component: PropTypes.elementType.isRequired,
  emotionCache: PropTypes.object,
  pageProps: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
};
```

Finally, create a `lib` directory at root level and create `createEmotionCache.ts` with the following content.

```typescript
import createCache from '@emotion/cache';

// prepend: true moves MUI styles to the top of the <head> so they're loaded first.
// It allows developers to easily override MUI styles with other styling solutions, like CSS modules.
export default function createEmotionCache() {
  return createCache({ key: 'css', prepend: true });
}
```

Before we continue, run `yarn dev` to make sure your NextJS application initializes without any issues.

## Creating a Home Page
The home page layout for a blog will always come down to personal preference. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will
create a simple list view for the blog posts.

Start by creating a `components/types.ts` file with the following types.

```typescript
export interface IBlogPost {
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  publishedDate: string;
}
```

Then create the following file `components/BlogPostSummary/index.tsx`, where `components` and `BlogPostSummary` are directories to be created, starting from the project root. This will contain a simple summary for an individual blog post, to be rendered on the home page.

```typescript
import { IBlogPost } from '../types';
import NextLink from 'next/link';
import { Box, Link, Typography } from '@mui/material';

interface BlogPostSummaryProps {
  post: IBlogPost,
  key: number,
}

const BlogPostSummary = (props: BlogPostSummaryProps) => {

  const { post, key } = props;

  return (
    <Box key={key} sx={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
      <NextLink href={`/blog/${post.slug}`} passHref>
        <Link sx={{ textDecoration: 'none' }}>
          <Typography variant={'body1'}>{post.title}</Typography>
        </Link>
      </NextLink>
      <Typography variant={'caption'}>{post.publishedDate}</Typography>
    </Box>
  )
}

export default BlogPostSummary;
```

The component code is quite self explanatory; We take in props that represent an individual blog post and render it inside a flex container. The post title is wrapped within the [NextLink](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) component, which links it to the actual blog post page (which we are yet to build).

> NextLink is a Link component exported by next/link which handles client-side transitions in NextJS.

Let's add some dummy post content to support our development work until we integrate `MDX`. Create the following file starting at the project root `data/dummyData.ts` with the following content.

```typescript
export const posts = [
  {
    title: 'My First Blog Post',
    slug: 'first-post',
    publishedDate: '02-06-2022',
  },
  {
    title: 'My Second Blog Post',
    slug: 'second-post',
    publishedDate: '01-05-2022',
  },
];
```

Now lets fix the home page to display a summary list of all our blog posts. Go to `pages/index.tsx` (which is our home page), and replace its content with the following code.

```typescript:Home pages/index.tsx:collapsed
import type { NextPage } from 'next';
import { Box, CssBaseline, Grid, Typography } from '@mui/material';
import BlogPostSummary from '../components/BlogPostSummary';
import { IBlogPost } from '../components/types';
import { posts } from '../data/dummyData';

interface HomeProps {
  posts: IBlogPost[];
}

const Home: NextPage<HomeProps> = (props) => {

  const { posts } = props;

  return (
    <Box>
      <CssBaseline />
      <Grid container sx={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
        <Grid item xs={12} mb={4}>
          <Box>
            <Typography variant={'h2'}>Welcome to my blog</Typography>
          </Box>
        </Grid>
        <Grid item xs={12}>
          <Grid container sx={{ width: '50%', margin: 'auto', textAlign: 'left' }}>
            <Grid item xs={12}>
              <Typography variant={'h4'} py={4}>Latest Posts</Typography>
            </Grid>
            <Grid item xs={12}>
              {
                posts.map((post, index) => {
                  return (
                    <BlogPostSummary post={post} key={index}/>
                  );
                })
              }
            </Grid>
          </Grid>
        </Grid>
      </Grid>
    </Box>
  );
};

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  return { props: { posts } };
};

export default Home;
```

The Home page code is again pretty self explanatory; It receives an array of posts via props, and each post is then rendered on to the home page using the `BlogPostSummary` component which we just developed.

However, anyone new to NextJS might be curious about the `getStaticProps` function at the very bottom of the component. [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) is an asynchronous function that is executed on the server, when the page is requested by the client. The data returned by this function is used by NextJS to pre-render the page on the server. It should be noted that, although it sits in a client side component, `getStaticProps` always runs on the server and never on the client.

For now, we have hard-coded an array of posts to be returned from the `getStaticProps` function. Once we complete the `mdx` integration, this content will be dynamically extracted from our blog post files.

## Creating The Post Page

Now that we have the home page set up with a list of blog posts, the next step is to create a page for a single blog post.

### Blog Post Header

First add the following type interface that represents a post's front matter to `components/types.ts`. Front matter is simply meta data related to an individual blog post.

```typescript
export interface IFrontMatter {
  publishedAt: string;
  readingTime: {
    minutes: number;
    text: string;
    time: number;
    words: number;
  };
  slug: string;
  summary: string;
  title: string;
  wordCount: number;
  coverImage: string;
  shareUrl: string;
}
```

Then create the blog post header component at `components/BlogPostHeader/index.tsx`. This component will have the responsibility of rendering the blog title, some meta information related to the post, and the hero image for the blog post.

```typescript:BlogPostHeader:collapsed
import Image from 'next/image';
import { Box } from '@mui/system';
import Typography from '@mui/material/Typography';
import * as React from 'react';
import { IFrontMatter } from '../types';

interface IBlogPostHeader {
  frontMatter: IFrontMatter;
}

const BlogPostHeader = (props: IBlogPostHeader) => {
  const { frontMatter } = props;

  return (
    <Box sx={{ marginX: 0, marginTop: 4 }}>
      <Typography
        variant={'h4'}
        sx={{ py: 1, fontWeight: 'bold', textAlign: 'left' }}
      >
        {frontMatter?.title}
      </Typography>
      <Box
        sx={{
          display: 'flex',
          flexDirection: {
            xs: 'column',
            sm: 'row',
          },
          justifyContent: 'space-between',
          mb: 2,
          gap: 2,
        }}
      >
        <Box>
          <Typography
            variant={'caption'}
            sx={{
              textAlign: 'left',
            }}
          >
            {frontMatter?.publishedAt}
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant={'caption'} sx={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
            {frontMatter?.readingTime?.text}
          </Typography>
        </Box>
      </Box>
      <Box sx={{ mb: 4 }}>
        <Image
          width={'100%'}
          height={55}
          src={`/${frontMatter?.coverImage}`}
          alt="hero image"
          layout="responsive"
          quality={100}
        />
      </Box>
    </Box>
  );
};

export default BlogPostHeader;
```
### Blog Post Page

With the header component ready, lets create the page that will render any given blog post. Create the following file starting from the root of the project directory, `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`.

Two things to take note here:

1. The pages directory typically contains React components exported from a file, which maps to a URL route based on its file name. For example a component exported from `pages/blog/index.tsx`, will be rendered when accessing the url `<host>/blog`.

2. Using a square-bracket naming convention (`[slug].tsx`) provides support for [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes), which is required for this page, as each blog post will have its own unique URL based on its slug.

The `[slug].tsx` file will have the following code in it.

```typescript:[slug].tsx:collapsed
import * as React from 'react';
import { Box, Container, Divider } from '@mui/material';
import CssBaseline from '@mui/material/CssBaseline';
import BlogPostHeader from '../../components/BlogPostHeader';
import { IFrontMatter } from '../../components/types';

interface IBlogProps {
  frontMatter: IFrontMatter;
}
export default function Blog({ frontMatter }: IBlogProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Container
        sx={{
          display: 'flex',
          px: {
            md: 8,
            sm: 4,
            xs: 3,
          },
        }}
      >
        <CssBaseline />
        <Box
          sx={{
            margin: 'auto',
            marginTop: { md: 0, xs: '56px' },
            maxWidth: '820px',
          }}
        >
          <BlogPostHeader frontMatter={frontMatter} />
          <Divider
            sx={{
              marginBottom: {
                lg: 8,
                xs: 6,
              },
              color: 'primary.main',
              width: '100%',
              marginX: 'auto',
            }}
          />
          {/* TBA: blog content goes here */}
        </Box>
      </Container>
    </>
  );
}

```

The `[slug].tsx` component is again quite simple to understand. Whenever a user accesses the path `/blog/*`, the `[slug].tsx` component will be rendered, which would (eventually!) render the entire blog post.

Of course, for the moment we only have the `BlogPostHeader` component within the render method. Even then, there are no post specific props being consumed, and there definitely is no visible content when the page is rendered.

The missing props problem can be addressed by adding in a `getStaticProps` function with a hard-coded return object to the same file; However when `getStaticProps` is used for a page with dynamic routes, it should always be accompanied with a [getStaticPaths](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-paths) method. The latter's responsibility is to evaluate all possible dynamic routes for the page, while the former is responsible to provide the correct props for a given dynamic route.

With this information, lets first add a `getStaticPaths` method like so:

```typescript
import { posts } from '../../data/dummyData';
...

export async function getStaticPaths() {

  return {
    paths: posts.map((post) => ({
      params: {
        slug: post.slug,
      },
    })),
    fallback: false,
  };
}
```

The above code is fairly straight-forward. `getStaticPaths` evaluates all possible paths for the dynamic page (in this case it is based on the list of available posts), and returns an object with this information. When a dynamic route is being called, `getStaticProps` will receive the appropriate path information from this generated object.

The job of `getStaticProps` essentially remains the same, albeit slightly more complicated; Now it needs to "know" which set of props to return based on the current active path.

```typescript
export async function getStaticProps({ params }: any) {
  const frontMatter = posts.find(post => post.slug === params.slug);
  return {
    props: {
      frontMatter,
    }
  };
}
```

As you can see, `getStaticProps` receives the same `params` attribute generated by `getStaticPaths` for the current path, identified by the `slug` attribute. This information is then used to retrieve the correct `frontMatter` for the post, which is fed to the `[slug]` component during render.

With this, most of the base framework of our blog is now complete. We have a UI library integrated with NextJS, a dynamic framework configured to render a list of blog posts, and a functional dynamic page to view an individual blog post. In part 02 of this article series, we will look at integrating MDX, so that we have actual content for our blog, written in markdown and rendered seamlessly via React components.
