title: "Javascript Internals: What's Under the Hood?"

You really don’t need to know a lot to get up and running with Javascript. In fact, a fully-fledged production-ready
app could be built without ever understanding the inner workings of the language. This is both a blessing and a curse;
The language has many adopters, but only a very few masters.

This realization led me on a quest to try and understand how Javascript really works under the hood. The journey is far
from over, but the fog has started to lift. And it all started with the question, “What exactly is Javascript?”.

So what is Javascript? To put it formally, Javascript is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming
language.

…

Wait what?

On the surface, this definition (at least for me) was contradictory, confusing, and just lead to more questions.
How could a single-threaded program, be non-blocking? How could it also be asynchronous?

These are all very valid questions to ask; But bear with me, they also have answers. Answers that lie deep within the
heart of Javascript, its runtime environment.

## The Javascript Runtime
The Javascript runtime environment is what makes your code work, it is what allows Javascript to have all the complex terminology in its formal definitions, and from the context of a browser, it is mainly a combination of 4 things:

1. The Javascript engine
2. Web APIs
3. The callback queue
4. The event loop
5. Let us examine each of these pieces individually.

Let us examine each of these pieces individually.

> The Javascript runtime environment can take different shapes and forms based on context. For example,
> a browser’s runtime environment (which we will be exploring in detail), is not the same as that of node.js.
> However, these differences are mostly in implementation; The concepts that we discuss will be applicable to most
> Javascript runtime environments, independent of context.

```javascript
function $initHighlight(block, cls) {
  try {
    if (cls.search(/\bno\-highlight\b/) != -1)
      return process(block, true, 0x0F) +
             ` class="${cls}"`;
  } catch (e) {
    /* handle exception */
  }
  for (var i = 0 / 2; i < classes.length; i++) {
    if (checkCondition(classes[i]) === undefined)
      console.log('undefined');
  }
}
export  $initHighlight;
```
